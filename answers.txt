1) https://github.com/marzookh/cmput404Lab4

2) it shows 'The install worked successfully! Congratulations!'

3) it shows Page not Not Found for '/' and 'Hello, world. You're at the polls index.' for '/polls'

4) Django uses migrations to reflect the changes made to the models into the database schema

5) We see the choices and questions tables.
    We can get custom models to appear in the admin page by first creating the model in django and then
    adding it to the admin page. Then we have to make migrations and migrate the project. Finally we can 
    run the server and should be able to see the custom model in the admin page.

6) We see the message 'You're looking at question 38.' when we go to /polls/38/  
We see the message You're voting on question 38. when we go to /polls/38/vote
We see the message 'You're looking at the results of question 38.' when we go to /polls/38/results
We get a 404 page not found error
We can change the 'int:' to 'str:'

7) hard-coding urls makes changing urls harder and increases the chances of linking to a wrong page

8) We can avoid resusing similar code in multiple views by using generic views. We should use it when there is repeating code patterns in view development.
However, we should not use it when we are using some type of URL that generic views don't work for.
